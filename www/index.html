            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Space does not get much sun. So that people can enjoy the area, a structure could be built to capture the sun and reflect it into the area.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Visual projection on screen or walls of building</li>
              <li>Quadraphonic sound textures<br><small>(requires addition of structure to hold 4th speaker)</small></li>
              <li>Possibility of adding motion sensors<br><small>(investigate use of camera vs. privacy)</small></li>

            <h3>Open to student use</h3>
            <p>
              Public installation of interactive arts<br>
              is quite expensive, or impossible<br>
              <small>(try getting featured at the S.A.T.)</small>
            </p>
            <p>
              Students of IMCA, Computation Arts, Design and Electro Acoustic could use environment.<br>
              <small>Not restricted to those fields, but most likely candidates.</small>

            <p>There are screens used in theater that allow to see through when there is light from behind, and to project onto when desired.</p>

            <h3>Quadraphonic sound</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/proposition-03-speakers.jpg" width="640" height="320" alt="">
            <p>Addition of a structure at south-east end of space allows to create a room-shaped area, which would be perfect for confined sound diffusion.</p>

            <h3>St. Crickets in the Fields</h3>
            <p>While nickname was originally given because British armymen were playing cricket in the fields around St. Jax, it could be inspiring to use the nickname a bit more litteraly to create a piece to present in the space.</p>
            <p>Nature sounds and greenery could be generated depending on the movement,<br>or lackthereof, in the space.</p>

            <p>Inspired by Passeig de Sant Joan in Barcelona,<br>this simple design allows to have<br>an equal amount of greenery and floor.</p>

            <p>Circular tiles overlaid over the surface.</p>

            <p>Placing potted cedar hedges near the alley and near the fences of the private properties is a good way to add greenery, as well as to isolate the space to create more of an intimacy.</p>

            <p>Space does not seem to get much sun,<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundcover">ground cover</a> would be a better solution than grass.</p>
            <p>Space is likely to have lot of foot traffic,<br>to be taken into account.</p>
            <p>TODO: investigate what quality of soil plant requires vs. how it accepts to be stepped onto.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Color scheme</h3>
            <p>
              The current Webster building scheme<br>
              (concrete grey, a bit of burgundy and dark green)<br>
              is not all that inspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objects in the space could be<br>
              quite colorful to contrast the building.
